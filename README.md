# **🥊 UFC ELO Rating System**
#### **Scrape, Analyze, and Visualize UFC Fighter Rankings Over Time**

This project scrapes fight data from **UFCStats.com**, calculates **ELO ratings** for all fighters, and provides visualization tools to track and compare fighter performance over time. The system produces both **current and peak ELO rankings** and allows users to **compare fighter ELO progressions**.

## **📌 Features**
✔ **Web Scraper** – Collects fight history from [UFCStats.com](http://ufcstats.com/)  
✔ **ELO Rating System** – Dynamically updates fighter ratings based on wins, losses, and finishes  
✔ **Current & Peak ELO Leaderboards** – Generates an up-to-date ranking of all UFC fighters ever  
✔ **Fighter ELO Timeline** – Displays the historical progression of a fighter’s ELO rating  
✔ **Fighter Comparison** – Plots two fighters' ELO ratings over time on the same graph

## **🚀 Usage Guide**

### **1️⃣ Scrape Fight Data**
This script collects fight history from [UFCStats.com](http://ufcstats.com/).
```sh
python UFC_SCRAPE.py
```
✔ Outputs: `ufc_fights.csv` (Raw fight data)  

---

### **2️⃣ Calculate ELO Ratings**
Process the scraped data and compute **current & peak ELO scores** for all fighters.
```sh
python UFC_ELO.py
```
✔ Outputs:
- `ufc_fights_with_elo.csv` – Fight data including ELO scores
- `ufc_fighter_rankings.csv` – **Current and Peak ELO Leaderboards**

---

### **3️⃣ (Optional) Enrich Fight Data With Stats & Odds**
Add per-fight striking/grappling totals from UFCStats fight pages and attach closing odds when an **ODDS_API_KEY** (TheOddsAPI) is available.
```sh
python fight_data_enrichment.py
```
✔ Outputs: `ufc_fights_enriched.csv` – Includes significant strikes, takedowns, control time, and optional closing odds.

---

### **4️⃣ Train a Fight Outcome Model**
Use the engineered data to train tree-based classifiers (Random Forest, optional XGBoost) that predict whether `fighter_1` wins.
```sh
python fight_prediction_model.py --csv ufc_fights_with_elo.csv --output models
```
✔ Outputs: Model metrics in the console and serialized pipelines saved under `models/`.

---

### **5️⃣ View Fighter’s ELO Timeline**
Visualize how a specific fighter’s ELO rating has changed over time.
```sh
python FIGHTER_TIMELINE.py
```
✔ Enter a fighter’s name when prompted.  
✔ Generates a graph showing their ELO evolution.  

---

### **6️⃣ Compare Two Fighters’ ELO Progression**
Compare the historical ELO ratings of two fighters on the same graph.
```sh
python compare_fighters.py
```
✔ Enter two fighter names when prompted.  
✔ Generates a **side-by-side ELO progression chart**.

## **📌 How the ELO System Works**
- **Base ELO:** All fighters start at **1500**.  
- **K-Factor:** Adjusts how much ELO changes after a fight (**40** by default).  
- **Finishes (KO/TKO, Submission):** Rewarded with a **1.25x ELO boost**.  
- **ELO Adjustments:**  
  - **Win:** Fighter gains ELO, loser loses ELO.  
  - **Loss:** Fighter loses ELO, opponent gains ELO.  
  - **Draw:** Both fighters' ELO ratings adjust slightly.  
  - **No Contest (NC):** No ELO change.
